# Frontend Mentor - Project tracking intro component

![Design preview for the Project tracking intro component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## What is this?
This is my response to a front-end coding challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). Frontend Mentor provides great development challenges alongside beautiful designs, enabling you to build your skills using realistic projects.

I plan to take on most, if not all, of the free challenges in order from easiest (*'Newbie'*) to hardest (*'Advanced'*).

## The challenge
**Challenge #14**
**Difficulty: Junior**

This challenge was to build out an intro component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create the background shape using code

## My approach
I took a **mobile-first** approach, completing styling and layout for a 375px viewport width first. I then built out media queries to cater to larger widths.

I used **Sass** to easily implement elements provided in `style-guide.md`, and created the background shape using CSS **pseudo-elements**.

The end product is hosted on Vercel - https://project-tracking-intro-component-iota.vercel.app/
